# wordland.io

Wordland.io is a fun new kind of word game.

It's a meta-game, where you can set up the rules the way you want and then play.

Here are a few manifestations of wordland.io that could be fun to play, can you think of others? 

## Metapress
It's a 5x5 board.

You play against one opponent trying to claim as many tiles as you can.

The game ends when all 25 tiles are claimed.

Moves must be made within 5 days or the player forfeits the game.

## Lightning Metapress
Same as Metapress, but with a 7x7 board and moves must be made within 5 minutes instead of 5 days.

Optional: score big points with special bonus tiles

Optional: trade points for power-ups, weapons and special abilities

## Blitz Metapress
Same as Lightning Metapress, but not turn-based. 

Instead, it's a 4-player free-for-all, with one move allowed every 10 seconds, up to a max of 5 words per minute.

## Arena Combat
The board is 11x11.

There are two teams of two players each.

The game ends when all 121 tiles are claimed, the winning team having the most tiles.

Bonus tiles and power-ups enabled (or disabled) via unanimous consent before the game begins.

Move limits are one per hour and 10 moves per day.

## Lightning Arena Combat
Same as Arena Combat, but move limits are one every 5 minutes and 100 per day.

## Infinity Word
The board goes on forever in all directions. Terrain includes swamps, plains, walls and more.

Unlimited players.

Play as fast as you can to claim territory.

All bonus tiles and power-ups are enabled.

Higher-level players may encounter boss monsters or go on themed quests.

## Lightning Infinity Word
Same as Infinity Word, but you can play one word every 10 seconds, up to a maximum of 2000 words every 24 hours.

## More Thoughts on Game Mechanics

### Capture the Flag
Each player (or team) has one tile that is specially marked as a "flag tile" on the board.

The flag tile can be:
 * selected at random by the game
 * chosen by player before the game starts
 * chosen by player when they play their first word

If a player A captures the flag tile of player B, then player B is removed from the game and all of player B's tiles change ownership to player A. 

### Evaporation
Tile ownership begins aging from the moment it is claimed by a new owner.

A tile that is too old will lose its ownership and become an unclaimed tile.

Tiles that are protected age slower than unprotected tiles, and cannot lose ownership no matter how old they are.

In a round-robin-turn game, age is based on the number of turns that have passed since the tile was played.

In a time-based-turn game, age is based on wall-clock time.

A player's overall evaporation rate will increase proportionally with the number of tiles they own.
Different bonuses and special abilities can decrease the evaporation rate. 

### Custom Tile Skins
Allow players to select custom textures, graphics and decorations for their tiles.

Other players will see their tiles rendered with the custom skin.

### Themed Areas
Boards can have a special sponsored theme: Harry Potter, Star Wars, Lego, etc.

Custom graphics and special bonuses for use of words on the theme-list.

Prizes and free stuff.

### Player Avatar
Every player has a "player" avatar on the board. Players can interact when they are near.

Players could have stats/attributes and this could evolve into a full-on MMORPG.... 

### Structures and Terrain
Not every tile has to have a letter.
* Some tiles could be designated "public spaces", permanently blank and not claimable by any player.
* Some tiles could be "walls" that separate different places on the board, and cannot be occupied by a player avatar.
* Some tiles could be "water" or "lava" that cannot be occupied by a player avatar (or the player takes damage when they step there).

Different areas of the board could also have different shading to indicate different types of terrain.
* Swamp: slight green shade; letter distribution is much harder
* Beach: slight brown shade; letter distribution is much easier

### Challenge Areas
Portions of the board can be set aside as challenge areas for special games, or other special events

### Map View for Large Boards

Large and infinite-sized boards present a big challenge: it's impossible to visualize the entire board.
So, we have a "map view" shows some sizable portion of it.
Players can move the map view around to see big areas of the game board.
