# wordland.io client pack

Welcome to the wordland.io client pack. With these programs, you can play the word games offered on wordland.io,
since there is no web interface yet.

## How to play the game

Run `wl_play` to play the game.

You will be asked to enter a username.
If you choose, you can enter an email and password to setup an account, so you could play on different computers.
If you only enter a username, you will have an anonymous guest account.

Then you can choose a game room, and start a game.

## How to join a specific game that a friend has started

In your friend's game, their command prompt will be `username@room>>>`.
Have your friend tell you the room name, and on your computer, run `wl_play <room>`, where `<room>` is the name of the room.

## How to browse game rooms

Run `wl_rooms` to see all available rooms. You can view the settings for each room and start a new game from there.

## How to convert your anonymous account into a logged-in account

Run `wl_sign_up` to sign up for an account. This will convert an existing guest account into an email-based account.
